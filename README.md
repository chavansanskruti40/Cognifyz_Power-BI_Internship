## ✨ TASK-4 : Investment Duration & Frequency

As a part of Internship at Cognifyz Technologies,I have been tasked to analyse investment durations and monitoring frequencies.

### 💠 Objective: 
To gain insights into how long investors hold their investments and how frequently they monitor them.

##### ✤ Duration Distribution: 
I visualized the distribution of investment durations using bar charts in Power BI. This helped in identifying that the majority of investors prefer medium-term investments (1-5 years), with the highest number of investments falling in the 3-5 year category.

##### ✤ Frequency Analysis: 
I analyzed investment monitoring frequencies through bar charts. The findings revealed that most investors monitor their investments on a monthly basis. I then examined how this monitoring frequency impacts their investment choices.

### 💠 Key Insights:

##### ➤ Medium-Term Preference: 
Investors predominantly prefer holding their investments for 3-5 years.

##### ➤ Monthly Monitoring: 
The majority of investors prefer to monitor their investments monthly, which appears to be a common strategy for managing medium-term investments.

✅ This project enhanced my skills in data visualization and analysis using Power BI and provided valuable insights into investor behavior.

## ✨ TASK 5 : Reasons of Investment

► As part of my internship at Cognifyz, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the reasons why individuals choose to invest. 

### 💠 Objective: 
To analyze and visualize the primary reasons driving investment decisions.

### 💠 Steps Taken:

##### ✤Visualization:
Created detailed charts in Power BI to display the distribution and frequency of investment reasons.
Visualized how investment durations and monitoring frequencies vary by reason.


### 💠 Key Insights:
➤ Better Returns is the dominant reason for investment, indicating that investors are primarily motivated by high potential gains.

➤ Fund Diversification is also a significant reason, suggesting that investors are interested in spreading their risks across various assets.

➤ Tax Benefits is the least common reason, implying it is not a primary motivator for most investors in the dataset.

##### 💠Investment Duration:
➤ The majority of investments, regardless of reason, are held for 3-5 years.

➤ A significant portion also prefers a 1-3 year duration.

➤ Very few investors hold investments for less than 1 year or more than 5 years.

##### 💠Monitoring Frequency:
➤ Most investors prefer to monitor their investments monthly, indicating a preference for regular but not overly frequent oversight.

➤ Weekly and daily monitoring are less common, suggesting these are either less necessary or less feasible for most investors.

✅ These insights can help in understanding the primary motivations and behaviors of investors, which can be useful for financial planning and advising.
